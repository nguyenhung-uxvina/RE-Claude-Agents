## Appendix B: Calculation Details

### Weighted Score Calculation

```
Weighted Score = Σ (Weight_i × Score_i)

Example for S1:
= (0.20 × C1) + (0.15 × C2) + (0.15 × C3) + (0.10 × C4)
  + (0.20 × C5) + (0.10 × C6) + (0.10 × C7)
= [Calculation]
```

### Percentage of Ideal

```
Percentage = (Weighted Score / 10.0) × 100%
```
